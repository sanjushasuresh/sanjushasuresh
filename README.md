I believe data is more than just numbers â€” itâ€™s a language that reveals patterns, tells stories, and guides smarter decisions. My journey into data science began with a simple curiosity: Why do things happen the way they do? That curiosity evolved into a purpose â€” to develop AI-driven solutions that create meaningful, real-world impact.

I have spent the last 15 months delving into data problems through internships that have challenged both my technical and collaborative abilities. From designing end-to-end machine learning pipelines and refining noisy datasets to translating analytical results into business insights. Every project has strengthened my belief that technology, when applied thoughtfully, can drive meaningful change.

Beyond my professional journey, Iâ€™m an active learner, constantly exploring emerging tools, real-world case studies, and community collaborations. I aim to grow into someone who not only builds solutions but helps shape smarter, more empathetic systems. <br>
